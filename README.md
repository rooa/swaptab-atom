# NOTE
After creating this package, I found that Atom already has an equivalent builtin command.
Please refer to [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/keymaps/darwin.cson#L31)..

## swaptab-atom

Move your tab with one command.

### Default keymap
- `ctrl-cmd-shift-K`: move active tab to the right
- `ctrl-cmd-shift-J`: move active tab to the left
